# Algorithms and data structures 2

There are numerous implementations of data structures (set, list, trie, heap, AVL tree), classes, iterators and templates. 
There are exercises that use those implementations too.
I learned about different sorting algorithms(Insertion, Binary Search, Bucket Sort, Quick Sort etc) and Divide and Conquer methods(Merge sort) among other things.

In the assignments folder is the core assignment of the subject that is divided into 3:
	- Specification of the solution of a real life problem.
	- Design of the solution.
	- Implementation of the solution.

Important keywords from this projects: C++, data structures, classes, templates, design, problem resolution.
