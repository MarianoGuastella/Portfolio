The university repository contains projects spanning various subjects:

# Algorithms and Data Structures 1:

Includes a console-based Minesweeper game, a tweet generator using Markov chains, and a recursive drawing generator.
Key concepts: Python, logic, data structures, file manipulation, object-oriented programming (OOP).

# Algorithms and Data Structures 2:

Focuses on implementations of data structures, sorting algorithms, and divide-and-conquer methods.
Includes core assignments divided into specification, design, and implementation.
Key concepts: C++, data structures, classes, templates, problem resolution.

# Algorithms and Data Structures 3:

Introduces new problem-solving techniques and heuristics.
Assignments cover topics like brute force, backtracking, dynamic programming, and heuristics for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Utilizes Latex, C++, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn).
Key concepts: C++, Python, heuristics, dynamic programming, TSP.

# Operating Systems:

Focuses on concurrency and synchronization.
Assignments include implementing ConcurrentHashMap for text processing.
Utilizes Latex, C++, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn).
Key concepts: C++, threads, concurrency, synchronization.
These projects offer practical applications of key concepts in programming, data structures, and problem-solving across various languages and domains.
