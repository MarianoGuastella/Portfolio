# Proyects of Algorithms and Data Structures I (Python)

This projects are in spanish as they were my first steps into the programming world and I don't want to modify anything.

- Buscaminas_en_consola is a minesweeper to play on console. Pretty simple implementation using an array for the board, prompting for input and processing 
each move until all mines are cleared. Instructions are display when the game starts.

- Generador_tweets is a tweet generator using a Markov chain. Reads a formatted file full of tweets and stores a dictionary for each user where for each 
word it stores the following ones that have appeared. You can ask for a random tweet generation (displayed on console) and store it as a favorite (in a file). 
Also you can read the trends tags from the tweets file.

- Generador_dibujos is a recursive drawing generator that uses my implementation of the Turtle module. It requires a name file for the final drawing (svg), 
a number of iterations and the file with the instructions. The file format is displayed if the arguments do not match. It takes the instructions and iterate 
the number of times requested while changing the angle. Be careful not to go through a large number of iterations because it won't finish.
