In this proyect I learned about Concurrency and Synchronization. Note that in this assignments there are
pdf files simulating a paper about the subject, all the explanation about the problem and the solutionis there. 
We used Latex, C++, Python (panda, numpy, seaborn).

-Assignment 1: We made an implementation of a data structure called ConcurrentHashMap, which is based on a
open hash table and uses linked lists to handle collisions. This structure has a similar interface
to that of a dictionary, where the keys are text strings. The purpose of this implementation is to be able to
use it to process text files and count the number of occurrences of distinct words. In this case, the
words will be used as keys and their respective number of occurrences as associated values.

Important keywords from this projects: C++, threads, concurrency, synchronization.
