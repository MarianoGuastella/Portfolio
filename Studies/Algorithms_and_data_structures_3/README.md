# Algorithms and data structures 3

In this subject I learned new technics to find a solution for a problem but also I learned about Heuristics 
because there are multiple problems that you can't find the perfect solution. Note that in this assignments there are
pdf files simulating a paper about the subject, all the explanation about the problem and the solutionis there. 
We used Latex, C++, Python (panda, numpy, seaborn).

First assignment uses Brute Force, Backtracking and Dynamic programming to solve a real life problem.

Second assignment is about Heuristics in order to solve the TSP (Travelling salesman problem). Heuristics used:
- Nearest neighbor (greedy)
- Minimum spanning tree
- Local search
- Taboo search

Important keywords from this projects: C++, data structures, Python, Heuristics, Backtracking, Dynamic programming,
panda, numpy, seaborn.
